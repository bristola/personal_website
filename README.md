# Austin Bristol's Personal Website

This repository holds the source code for my personal website which can be found
at [austinbristol.com](austinbristol.com). It has been made by myself, along
with its own HTML and css code designed for the website. This website contains
information about myself while looking for employment opportunities and for life
in general. Acts a lot like an online resume.

## Installation

1. First you must clone the website into your own computer.

2. Next, if you do not have npm you must install it.

3. Install gatsby to run the website, using the command `npm install -g gatsby-cli`

4. Make sure you traverse to the root of the Git repository.

5. Finally, run the command `gatsby develop`

6. The site can then be seen and updated at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Tools

This was built using the Gatsby, which is a CLI and framework for developing
websites. It was originally started as the Gatsby starter site. Also, it is
deployed using Netlify which is directly connected to this GitHub repository.
This deployment directly goes to the domain name austinbristol.com. You can
easily deploy your own website on Netlify by just having a GitHub repository for
your website and linking it to Netlify. Whenever code is pushed to the
repository, it automatically gets updated on the actual deployed website.
